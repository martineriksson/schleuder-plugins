= Schleuder Plugins

This is a collection of small plugins for [Schleuder](http://schleuder2.nadir.org).

Install a plugin by placing the file in your plugins directory. On my Debian machine it is /etc/schleuder/plugins but your setup might be different. Plugins are hot-loaded whenever a message is processed, so there is no need to restart Schleuder.
